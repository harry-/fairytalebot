story|function|text
wikipedia|INITIAL SITUATION|After the initial situation is depicted, the tale takes the following sequence of 31 functions:
wikipedia|ABSENTATION| A member of the hero's community or family leaves the security of the home environment. This may be the hero themselves, or it may be some other relation that the hero must later rescue. This division of the cohesive family injects initial tension into the storyline. This may serve as the Hero's introduction, typically portraying them as an ordinary person.
wikipedia|INTERDICTION| A forbidding edict or command is passed upon the hero ('don't go there', 'don't do this'). The hero is warned against some action.
wikipedia|VIOLATION of INTERDICTION| The prior rule is violated. Whether performed by the Hero by accident or temper, a third party or a foe, this generally leads to negative consequences. The villain enters the story via this event, although not necessarily confronting the hero. They may be a lurking and manipulative presence, or might act against the Hero's family in his absence.
wikipedia|RECONNAISSANCE| The villain makes an effort to attain knowledge needed to fulfill their plot. Disguises are often invoked as the villain actively probes for information, perhaps for a valuable item or to abduct someone. They may speak with a member of the family who innocently divulges a crucial insight. The villain may also seek out the hero in their reconnaissance, perhaps to gauge their strengths in response to learning of their special nature.
wikipedia|DELIVERY| The villain succeeds at recon and gains a lead on their intended victim. A map is often involved in some level of the event.
wikipedia|TRICKERY| The villain attempts to deceive the victim to acquire something valuable. They press further, aiming to con the protagonists and earn their trust. Sometimes the villain make little or no deception and instead ransoms one valuable thing for another.
wikipedia|COMPLICITY| The victim is fooled or forced to concede and unwittingly or unwillingly helps the villain. The villain is now free to access somewhere previously off-limits, like the privacy of the hero's home or a treasure vault, acting without restraint in their ploy.
wikipedia|VILLAINY or LACKING| The villain harms or injures a family member, including but not limited to abduction, theft, spoiling crops, plundering, banishment or expulsion of one or more protagonists, committing murder, threatening a forced marriage, providing nightly torments and so on. Simultaneously or alternatively, a protagonist finds they desire or require something lacking from the home environment (a potion or artifact etc.). The villain may still be indirectly involved in the latter option, perhaps fooling the family member into believing they need such an item.
wikipedia|MEDIATION| One or more of the negative factors covered above comes to the attention of the Hero, who uncovers the deceit/perceives the lacking/learns of the villainous acts that have transpired.
wikipedia|BEGINNING COUNTER-ACTION| The hero considers ways to resolve the issues, by seeking a needed magical item, rescuing those who are captured or otherwise thwarting the villain. This is a defining moment for the hero, one that shapes their further actions and marks the point when they begin to fit their noble mantle.
wikipedia|DEPARTURE| The hero leaves the home environment, this time with a sense of purpose. Here begins their adventure.
wikipedia|FIRST FUNCTION OF THE DONOR| The hero encounters a magical agent or helper (donor) on their path, and is tested in some manner through interrogation, combat, puzzles or more.
wikipedia|HERO'S REACTION| The hero responds to the actions of their future donor; perhaps withstanding the rigours of a test and/or failing in some manner, freeing a captive, reconciles disputing parties or otherwise performing good services. This may also be the first time the hero comes to understand the villain's skills and powers, and uses them for good.
wikipedia|RECEIPT OF A MAGICAL AGENT| The hero acquires use of a magical agent as a consequence of their good actions. This may be a directly acquired item, something located after navigating a tough environment, a good purchased or bartered with a hard-earned resourced or fashioned from parts and ingredients prepared by the hero, spontaneously summoned from another world, a magical food that is consumed, or even the earned loyalty and aid of another.
wikipedia|GUIDANCE| The hero is transferred, delivered or somehow led to a vital location, perhaps related to one of the above functions such as the home of the donor or the location of the magical agent or its parts, or to the villain.
wikipedia|STRUGGLE| The hero and villain meet and engage in conflict directly, either in battle or some nature of contest.
wikipedia|BRANDING| The hero is marked in some manner, perhaps receiving a distinctive scar or granted a cosmetic item like a ring or scarf.
wikipedia|VICTORY| The villain is defeated by the hero - killed in combat, outperformed in a contest, struck when vulnerable, banished, and so on.
wikipedia|LIQUIDATION| The earlier misfortunes or issues of the story are resolved; object of search are distributed, spells broken, captives freed.
wikipedia|RETURN| The hero travels back to their home.
wikipedia|PURSUIT| The hero is pursued by some threatening adversary, who perhaps seek to capture or eat them.
wikipedia|RESCUE| The hero is saved from a chase. Something may act as an obstacle to delay the pursuer, or the hero may find or be shown a way to hide, up to and included transformation unrecognisably. The hero's life may be saved by another.
wikipedia|UNRECOGNIZED ARRIVAL| The hero arrives, whether in a location along their journey or in their return home, and is unrecognised or unacknowledged.
wikipedia|UNFOUNDED CLAIMS| A false hero presents unfounded claims or performs some other form of deceit. This may be the villain, one of the villain's underlings or an unrelated party. It may even be some form of future donor for the hero, once they've faced their actions.
wikipedia|DIFFICULT TASK| A trial is proposed to the hero - riddles, test of strength or endurance, acrobatics and other ordeals.
wikipedia|SOLUTION| The hero accomplishes a difficult task.
wikipedia|RECOGNITION| The hero is given due recognition - usually by means of their prior branding.
wikipedia|EXPOSURE| The false hero and/or villain is exposed to all and sundry.
wikipedia|TRANSFIGURATION| The hero gains a new appearance. This may reflect aging and/or the benefits of labour and health, or it may constitute a magical remembering after a limb or digit was lost (as a part of the branding or from failing a trial). Regardless, it serves to improve their looks.
wikipedia|PUNISHMENT| The villain suffers the consequences of their actions, perhaps at the hands of the hero, the avenged victims, or as a direct result of their own ploy.
wikipedia|WEDDING| The hero marries and is rewarded or promoted by the family or community, typically ascending to a throne.
